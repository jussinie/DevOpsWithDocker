This is a simple build service. It will pull a repo from Github, create a Docker image from it and push it to Docker Hub. 
**Requirements:**
Github repo needs to have a Dockerfile. 
You will also need to have an account in Docker hub. 
The service will prompt you to give the url to the github repo. 
After that you need to give a folder name (that is the last part from the github repo name) 
In the end, provide your docker username and password.
